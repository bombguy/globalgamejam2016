# Life of a Probe
*#globalgamejam2016*

You are a young magician wishing to test your summoning limits.
Collect mana orbs to power your summon. 
Collect Dream or Dragon orbs to choose your possession. But collecting both will cancel each other. While possessed, picking up a mana orb will give you a charge of Q power to defeat your enemies. Kill enemies and bosses quickly before your possession expires!
